This is a static [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) site providing a searchable library of all the algorithms in [The Algorithms](https://github.com/TheAlgorithms). All the data about the algorithms get fetched from the `DIRECTORY.md` files in all the different repositories.

## Translating the website

You can help us translate the [TheAlgorithms](https://the-algorithms.com) website using [Weblate](https://hosted.weblate.org/engage/TheAlgorithms/?utm_source=widget). If you're not sure about if your translation is OK, better submit a suggestion, and someone else will review it. Here is the list of the current languages:

## Getting Started

If you haven't installed it yet, install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) and [yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install#windows-stable). Then, install all the dependencies:

```bash
yarn
```

After that, run the script that fetches all the algorithms from GitHub:

```bash
yarn fetch-algorithms
```

Finally, run the development server:

```bash
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the website.

## Contributing

Try to use the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/#summary) naming convention.

If you want to add a new feature or fix a bug, create a new branch or fork and commit there. Before opening a PR be sure to

- Run `yarn lint` and fix potential errors
- Run `yarn build` to check if everything still builds successfully

Open the pull request against `main`. Vercel will automatically create a preview deployment and the pull request will be squash merged after being reviewed by a member.

If you are a member and just want to add a small fix you can also directly commit to `main` instead of opening a pull request.
