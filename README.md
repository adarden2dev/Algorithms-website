# [The Algorithms](https://github.com/TheAlgorithms) official website

This is a static [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) site providing a searchable library of all the algorithms in [The Algorithms](https://github.com/TheAlgorithms).

All the data about the algorithms get fetched from the `DIRECTORY.md` files in all the different repositories.

## Getting Started

First, install all the dependencies:

```bash
yarn
```

Then, run the script that fetches all the algorithms from GitHub:

```bash
yarn fetch-algorithms
```

Finally, run the development server:

```bash
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the website.
